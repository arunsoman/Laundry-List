# Laundry-List
Things I want to do
1. integrate unikernel with the build process so that developer dont have to build docker images; build management system should output bootable images.
2. Light weight component which discovers user in IDM server and map them to roles defined in all micro-services; this should authenticate users via third party auth server, query internal stogare to discover predefined tolls defiend in all mirco services amd make JWT approprittly
3. light weight orchistration framwork for unikernels to run in a server farm, kubernatis is ok, but not sure
4. spark nodes as unikernels
5. provide data encryption for parquet
6. Some mechanisim to port existing third party apps into unikernels eg zeppelin etc
